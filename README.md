Port of SDMetricsOpenCore into maven, little changed except the build process. 
Trying to make a package which can be imported easily into another maven project.

Note: I removed some failing tests (9/310 tests)! 
Some specific features of the library may be failing, check the "full-test" branch to see the original test set.
